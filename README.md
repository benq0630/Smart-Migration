# Smart-Migration

# Migration agents are pivotal in assisting migrants with navigating the Australian immigration process, ensuring adherence to legal requirements and providing essential support. With a growing number of migration agents, each with varying expertise, migrants often struggle to find the most suitable agent, increasing their risk of falling victim to fraud and receiving inadequate services. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a Machine Learning Enabled Recommendation System designed to match migrants with appropriate migration agents based on their specific needs and preferences. The project involves generating synthetic data, selecting an appropriate machine learning model, and performing rigorous training, testing, and validation to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the recommendation system. Skills Required: Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Python (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch), Database and Data Management, Statistical Analysis
